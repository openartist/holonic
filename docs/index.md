# Be a part of a greater whole.
Holons is growing a network of coliving communities that are values aligned.

## Establishing a legal framework for flourishing
The project is working towards easily replicatable legal frameworks to allow everyone to create communitu confederations aligned with our highest visions.

## A vision for flexible coliving
We are brining together people interested in evolving consciousness and culture to collaborate on the future of community and co-own property around the world. You may live there all time or just come to visit. Communities can be designed around purpose and vision: as a coliving hub for digital nomads or as residential retreat centers.

## Your voice is heard
Every community is created with a governance template that can be customized according to your needs. Resident members guide the direction of their properties. Your vote is legally protected according to HOM incorporation templates.

## Not (just) Web3
This is not a Crypto-bubble tech company. The methods are agnostic to crypto and Web3 technoogies. In many cases it is easier to kickstart communities and manage them without smart contract creation, tokenization, and technology bloat. Our recommended solutions involve traditional (and simple) company creation, fundraising, and asset management.

## Evolved values, built in
Holons has established a contemporary integral spiritual manifesto informed by the most profound teachings our collective spiritual heritage. This is the bedrock of our vision of creating true "Higher We" spaceâ€”a place to be in company with link-minded purpose-aligned individuals committed to our collective evolution.

## Locations around the world
We are currently looking for collaborators and community founders ready to take the next step in creating a network of communities around the world.
