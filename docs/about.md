# About Holons

Holons is creating a legal framework for the purchase and governance for holoseumsâ€”holonic coliving and retreat centers.

LLCs (limited liability companies) can have some advantages over corporations, including:
Ownership flexibility
LLCs can have an unlimited number of owners, and there are no restrictions on who can be an owner.
Distribution flexibility
LLCs can distribute income as they wish, while corporations must distribute profits evenly on a dollar per share basis.
Tax flexibility
LLCs have more tax flexibility than corporations, and can avoid double taxation. LLCs can pass profits through to their owners as personal income, which is called pass-through taxation. LLCs also don't pay corporate taxes unless they elect to be taxed as a C corp.
